# üì¶ü¶ã charted TestKit
charted **TestKit** is a testing library for [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), which extends [`libtest`] with its own [`test`] macro. The library can also be used for only Testcontainers as well.

**TestKit** was built to make integration testing easier for Axum services with Testcontainers support and additional macros to help build assertions based off [`Response`]s.

## Example
```rust
use charted_testkit::{test, TestContext, assert_successful, consume_body};
use axum::{body::Bytes, routing, Router};
use hyper::Method;

async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

fn router() -> Router {
    Router::new().route("/", routing::get(hello))
}

#[test(router)]
async fn mytest(ctx: TestContext) {
    let res = ctx
        .request("/", Method::GET, None::<axum::body::Bytes>, |_| {})
        .await
        .expect("unable to send request");

    assert_successful!(res);

    let body = consume_body!(res);
    assert_eq!(body, Bytes::from_static(b"Hello, world!"));
}
```
